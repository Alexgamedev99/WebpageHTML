Wepage to learn html css javascript and backend
This is my first proper website which will be update every week until i conidered done.
My goal is to make a simple website where i can publish articles about various topics and in each article anyone could comment about it.
First i will build all the frontend elements with html css and some javascript.
Once all the frontend is finished i will make a database to store all the comments on every article, im thinking of using php at first but this could be changed depending of my necesities.
